# Auto Drawer-er

Auto drawer is a program that draws an image by controlling mouse movement and mouse clicks. Original logic by CoePSX on Autoit.

Forked from https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer

Renamed to Auto Drawer-er instead of giving it a version number for lulz, This ones the same but with added rando features I thought would be nice!

Please see the original wiki for how to use it: https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer/wiki
