# Auto Drawer-er

Auto drawer is a program that draws an image by controlling mouse movement and mouse clicks. Original logic by CoePSX on Autoit.

Forked from https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer

Renamed to Auto Drawer-er instead of giving it a version number for lulz, This ones the same but with added rando features I thought would be nice!

Please see the original wiki for how to use it: https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer/wiki

Changes I've Made So Far:

1. Changed the default presetting of Interval from 1000, to 100000. As not to freak people out with a crazy scribblebot upon leaving the setting default.
2. Changed some of the button labels, nothing major.
3. Changed the preview window look a bit, gave it a border, made it have opacity so you could see under it, and swapped some text around
4. Fixed the offset of the area select window, before it was off by a lot from the preview image when it started to draw, no more offset issues!
5. Gave it a cute red pencil as an icon, i unno, i'll think of something better later!
